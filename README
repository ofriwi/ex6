Sjavac: This is the main class. This class runs the main flow.
        The flow of the program is:
        1. Create a string array with all the lines.
        2. Create methods and global variables.
        3. Validate all the lines:
            3a. Validate the line.
            3b. If line is a block (if/while) create a Block object and:
                3b-1.Validate all lines in the block.
        4.  If a IOException is thrown, return 2.
            If a CodeException is thrown return 1.
            If no Exception is thrown return 0.

SjavacToStringArr: Convert the file to string array of lines.

scopes package: 1. Scope: Scope is a abstract class represents a scope in the code. It has it's own variables,
                and it can access it's parent scope's variables and methods.
                --> Block: if/while block
                --> MainScope: All the javac file. It has a list of Methods, and a list of lines.
                                It has a public next() method that runs the code as iterator.
                --> Method: a method in the code
                2. GlobalFactory: This class has static method that initializes all the globals (variables
                and methods) in the code to MainScope object.
buildingUnits package: This package contains all the 'building units' of the code - Lines, Variables and
                Exceptions.
                1. CodeException: This class is an exception represents an error in the code.
                2. Line: <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<SHANOS describe Line>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
                3. Variable: This class represents a variable. It has type, name and booleans that saves
                    its state.


Design Decisions:   1. A CodeException class gave us the option to add a try block around the main flow, and
                        understand when an error is a code error and when it's a IO error.
                    2. Using MainScope as iterator. This usage gave us the option to hold in memory only
                        the instance of MainScope, and then every time we called it, it gave the next line.
                         So when inside a different scope, we could call the next line without the need to
                         store each scope first and laast line.
                    3. Semi-Linear progression through code. We considered 3 alternatives to the program's
                        flow. 1 - Analyze line by line, 2 - Analyze all method in parallel, 3 - The
                        semi-linear, first we saved all the methods to memory and then inside each method we
                        analyzed it line after line. We chose option 3 because that way we analyzed the
                        globals before the method started running, but we didn't have to store any
                        information about the lines that are not Variable or Method declaration.
                        In other words we validated a line, and if it was OK we forgot it and didn't have
                        to store it.
                    4. Analyzing all String in one class. We only used Line object to analyze Strings
                        (using regex) to maintain a readable and clean code.
                    5. We used HashMaps to store Variables and Methods. It let us the possibillity to
                        access to methods and variables by name easily.

Answers to Questions:
    6.1. Error Handling - We created a CodeException object. When a code error is detected anywhere in the
    code, it throws an error up to the main. The main catches the error and print 1 to the screen. If we
    weren't use the CodeException object, we were not able to tell the difference between an IO exception
    and a Code exception, and we had to run more checks.
    6.2. OO Design
        a. We described above the classes and the Object Oriented design of the project.
        b. Our thinking progress - We payed attention that the code as hirerchial structure. The MainScope
             has some Methods inside, and each Method has some Blocks that can also contain other Blocks and
             so on. We saw that all of those Scopes share some common behaviour, and that each one could
             access {only} it's parent's variables and all MainScope's methods.
               So we created a Scope abstract object, that inherits to MainScope, Method and Block. Each one
             has a set of Variables and a pointer to it's parent Scope (while MainScope has a null pointer
             to indicate that it is the MainScope). Each scope also has a method that returns a list of the
             union of it's Vars with it's parent Vars, that gives priority to the child's Vars.
               We also thought that the code is built from lines that we have to validate, so we created
             Line class, and variables we had to save, so we created Variable class (as described above).
        c. Alternatives - an alternative could be pre-analyzing the code, and save each Scope first and
            last line. Than create a list of variables, each time a variable is initialized we save the
            initialization line and when we reach the line that ends it's scope, we remove this variable
            from the list.
            This alternative isn't using the Object Oriented Principle, and some of it's cons are that we
            have to store lots of information and to handle it manually, instead of letting Java's classes
            encapsulation handle it.
        d. Adding some features:
            - Classes: If we'd want to add classes, we would have to add a new class to our project: Class,
            that inherit from Scope and has a list of Methods. and we had to change the list of Methods in
            MainScope to list of Classes. Than we would pre-analyze all the classes, and then run on
            MainScope line by line as in our solution.
            - Standard Java Methods: If we'd like to use standard java methods, we would have to add a
            function to MainScope that adds all Java's Standard Methods and their arguments to the methods
            list, and call it from MainScope's constructor. Then, each time a standard method is called our
             validator would treat it has a defined function.
